#summary What to do next.

= Introduction =

This is some kind of roadmap for this project.

= Details =

 * Build Cairo as DLL instead of static library. Hopefully this is just a matter of sorting out various compiler DLL import/export settings, and doesn't need to deal with various writable static data.
 * Add support for ARMV5 target.
 * Build and run existing Cairo regression test-suite
 * Bugs fixing
 * Optimise Symbian OS surface backend
 * Migrate to Makefile build system
 * Integrate back to Cairo mainline
 * Port [http://www.gtk.org GTK+] to Symbian OS.
 * Study the feasibility of using [http://www.khronos.org/openvg/ OpenVG] to implement Symbian OS surface backend to enable hardware accelerated rendering.
