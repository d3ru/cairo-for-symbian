#summary What to do next.

= Introduction =

This is just a brain dump of what to do next in no particular order.

= Details =

 * Build Cairo as DLL instead of static library. This is just a matter of sorting out which DLL import/export macros to use for function declaration and definition.
 * Add support for ARM target (using both GCCE and RVCT compiler). Shouldn't bee too hard once Cairo is built as DLL.
 * Create SIS installer to test it on real Nokia phones
 * Implement Symbian OS surface backend (if it makes sense to do that), or is it enough to just use current approach of binding Cairo surface to a pixmap. It may be desirable to do on-screen rendering by creating Cairo surface that binds to a window. In a similar way to [http://www.khronos.org EGL], it may be necessary to support surface creation from a pixmap (eglCreatePixmapSurface) and a window (eglCreateWindowSurface). The problem is that Cairo does not support double-buffering (which is likely needed for a window surface) and relies on external module to do that. It will be difficult to do that in Symbian OS without introducing unique API to perform swap buffers (may be we can use cairo_surface_finish to do that?)
 * Learn more about Cairo font/text rendering mechanics
 * Implement Symbian OS font rendering backend (if possible at all). This is a very complex area which might be a real blocking issue. May end up requiring [http://www.freetype.org Freetype] to be used.
 * Build and run existing Cairo regression test-suite
 * Migrate to Makefile build system
 * Integrate back to Cairo mainline
