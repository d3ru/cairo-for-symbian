#summary What to do next.

= Introduction =

This is just a brain dump of what to do next in no particular order.

= Details =

 * Build Cairo as DLL instead of static library. This is just a matter of sorting out various compiler DLL import/export keyword to use for function declaration and definition.
 * Add support for ARMV5 target.
 * Implement Symbian OS surface backend to allow Cairo rendering to a window (RWindow). For off-screen rendering to a pixmap (CFbsBitmap), I think current approach using image surface functionality is sufficient.
 * Learn more about Cairo font/text rendering mechanics
 * Implement Symbian OS font rendering backend (if possible at all). This is a very complex area which might be a real blocking issue. May end up requiring [http://www.freetype.org Freetype] to be used in addition to built-in font rasterizer.
 * Build and run existing Cairo regression test-suite
 * Migrate to Makefile build system
 * Integrate back to Cairo mainline
