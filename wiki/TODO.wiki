#summary What to do next.

= Introduction =

This is just a brain dump of what to do next in no particular order.

= Details =

 * Build Cairo as DLL instead of static library
 * Add support for ARM target (using both GCCE and RVCT compiler)
 * Create SIS installer to test it on real Nokia phones
 * Implement Symbian OS surface backend (if it makes sense to do that), or is enough to just use current approach. It may be desirable to do on-screen rendering by creating Cairo surface that binds to a window.
 * Learn more about Cairo font/text rendering mechanics
 * Implement Symbian OS font rendering backend (if possible at all). This is a very complex area which might be a real blocking issue.
 * Build and run existing Cairo regression test-suite
 * Migrate to Makefile build system
 * Integrate back to Cairo mainline
