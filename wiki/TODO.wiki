#summary What to do next.

= Introduction =

This is some kind of roadmap for this project.

= Details =

 * Build Cairo as DLL instead of static library. Hopefully this is just a matter of sorting out various compiler DLL import/export settings, and doesn't need to deal with various writable static data.
 * Add support for ARMV5 target.
 * Learn more about Cairo font/text rendering mechanics
 * Implement Symbian OS font rendering backend. This is a complex area which might take a long time to deal with. May end up requiring [http://www.freetype.org FreeType] to be used in addition to Symbian OS built-in font rasterizer.
 * Build and run existing Cairo regression test-suite
 * Bugs fixing
 * Migrate to Makefile build system
 * Code review
 * Backend optimisation
 * Integrate back to Cairo mainline
